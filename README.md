## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webbedpiyush/litCalc-fe.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd litCalc-fe
```

Install the dependencies:

npm install
```

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit:
```bash
http://localhost:3000/
```

## Usage
- Launch the application in your browser.

- Use the canvas to draw mathematical, graphical, or pictorial inputs.

- Let the AI compute the results and watch the results rendered on the canvas.

- For mathematical inputs, you can simply draw symbols or type expressions.
- For graphical inputs, you can draw shapes like graphs or geometrical figures.
- For pictorial inputs, the AI recognizes shapes and computes relevant results, like areas or perimeters.
